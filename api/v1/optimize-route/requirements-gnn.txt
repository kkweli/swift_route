# Lightweight Route Optimization for Vercel Serverless
# Python 3.11+ (Vercel compatible)

# Core routing and graph algorithms (lightweight)
networkx>=3.2
numpy>=1.24.0

# Geospatial (minimal)
shapely>=2.0.0

# Database
supabase>=2.0.0

# Utilities
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Note: Heavy ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) are NOT compatible with Vercel serverless
# For GNN features, we'll use:
# 1. Pre-computed route weights stored in database
# 2. Optimized graph algorithms (A*, Dijkstra with custom heuristics)
# 3. Optional: External ML API for advanced predictions
